* `S3_BUCKET` - (optional) bucket used by Exhibitor for backups and coordination
* `S3_PREFIX` - (optional) key prefix within `S3_BUCKET` to use for this cluster
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - (optional) AWS access key ID with read/write permissions on `S3_BUCKET`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - (optional) secret key for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_REGION` - (optional) the AWS region of the S3 bucket (defaults to `us-west-2`)
* `ZK_PASSWORD` - (optional) the HTTP Basic Auth password for the "zk" user
* `ZK_DATA_DIR` - (optional) Zookeeper data directory
* `ZK_LOG_DIR` - (optional) Zookeeper log directory
* `HTTP_PROXY_HOST` - (optional) HTTP Proxy hostname
* `HTTP_PROXY_PORT` - (optional) HTTP Proxy port
* `HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME` - (optional) HTTP Proxy username
* `HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD` - (optional) HTTP Proxy password

Starting the container:

    docker run -p 8181:8181 -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 \
        -e S3_BUCKET=<bucket> \
        -e S3_PREFIX=<key_prefix> \
        -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key> \
        -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key> \
        -e HOSTNAME=<host> \
        mbabineau/zookeeper-exhibitor:latest

Once the container is up, confirm Exhibitor is running:

    $ curl -s localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/cluster/status | python -m json.tool
    [
        {
            "code": 3, 
            "description": "serving", 
            "hostname": "<host>", 
            "isLeader": true
        }
    ]
_See Exhibitor's [wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor/wiki/REST-Introduction) for more details on its REST API._

You can also check Exhibitor's web UI at `http://<host>:8181/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html`

Then confirm ZK is available:

    $ echo ruok | nc <host> 2181
    imok

### AWS IAM Policy
Exhibitor can also use an IAM Role attached to an instance instead of passing access or secret keys. This is an example policy that would be needed for the instance:
```
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::exhibitor-bucket/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::exhibitor-bucket"
            ],
            "Action": [
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

Starting the container:

    docker run -p 8181:8181 -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 \
        -e S3_BUCKET=<bucket> \
        -e S3_PREFIX=<key_prefix> \
        -e HOSTNAME=<host> \
